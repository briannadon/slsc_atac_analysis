task: You have been given subsampled ATAC-seq data from SCLC samples (FFPE Never-met,
  FFPE Met-associated, and FOXA2+ PDX). Using the provided paired-end FASTQ files
  and the analysis outputs, answer the following.
questions:
- id: q1
  stage: quality_control
  text: After adapter removal, what percentage of reads passed filtering in sample
    SRX26680004?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.5
- id: q2
  stage: alignment
  text: How many properly paired primary reads are mapped (not QC-fail, not duplicate)
    in sample SRX26680000?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q3
  stage: quality_control
  text: What is the duplication rate (percent) reported by fastp for sample SRX26680004?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.1
- id: q4
  stage: peak_calling
  text: How many significant peaks were called by MACS (narrowPeak) for sample SRX26680000?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q5
  stage: qc
  text: What is the FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks, percent) for sample SRX26680000?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
