task: You have been given subsampled ATAC-seq data from an FFPE primary SCLC tumor
  (SRX26680000). Using the provided paired-end FASTQ files and generated outputs,
  answer the following.
questions:
- id: q1
  stage: quality_control
  text: After adapter removal, what percentage of reads passed quality filtering in
    SRX26680000?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.5
- id: q2
  stage: alignment
  text: In SRX26680000, how many properly paired primary reads mapped to the nuclear
    genome (excluding QC-fail and duplicates)?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q3
  stage: chromatin_accessibility
  text: Which chromosome shows the highest number of accessible regions (peak count)
    in SRX26680000?
  answer_type: string_exact
- id: q4
  stage: chromatin_accessibility
  text: What is the median peak length (bp) among MACS narrowPeak calls for SRX26680000?
  answer_type: integer_exact
- id: q5
  stage: qc
  text: What is the FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks, percent) for SRX26680000?
  answer_type: numeric_percent
  tolerance: 0.5
